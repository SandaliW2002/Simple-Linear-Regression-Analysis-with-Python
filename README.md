# Simple-Linear-Regression-Analysis-with-Python
Dataset: Tabular data with numerical variables for prediction.

Tasks Performed:

Split dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Built and trained a linear regression model using scikit-learn.

Interpreted coefficients to understand variable relationships.

Evaluated model performance using R-squared and mean squared error (MSE).

Objectives:
✔ Predict target variable based on input features.
✔ Understand relationships between variables through regression coefficients.
✔ Develop a foundation for predictive modeling.

Tools & Libraries:
